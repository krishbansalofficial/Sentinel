    `journal_events.change_id` / `journal_effects.change_id` /
    `journal_effects.event_id` all use `ON DELETE CASCADE`, and
    `ChangeRepository.delete` relies on that cascade (A.4: "Change metadata

    fires a child table's own DELETE triggers for rows removed by a foreign
    key cascade action, exactly as it would for a direct `DELETE` statement --
    so migration 3's unconditional `BEFORE DELETE ... RAISE(ABORT)` triggers
    also aborted the legitimate cascade, not just direct tampering.

    The fix: a `WHEN` guard that only aborts when the row's own parent Change
    still exists. A direct `DELETE FROM journal_events WHERE ...` against a
    live Change is still rejected exactly as before (empirically verified);
    only a delete that is *itself* part of that Change's own cascade --
    which, by the time SQLite processes it, has already removed the parent
    `changes` row -- is allowed through. This is additive per this codebase's

    just `Path(executable_path).stem.lower()` (e.g. two completely
    unrelated binaries both named `tool.exe` in different directories both
    become name="tool"), two different executables sharing a filename stem
    collapsed onto the same manifest row: resolving the second one silently
    overwrote the first's artifact_digest in place, and any prior trust

    worse, an APPROVED decision for tool A could survive as an apparently

    `resolved_path` (the exact resolved executable/manifest path the
