"""Real `LifecycleFactsPort`: composes transition facts from wired evidence.

`repository_valid`/`contract_present` are structurally guaranteed once a
`ChangeView` exists (repository canonicalization and a `ChangeContract`
default both happen at Change-creation time), so they are always `True`
here rather than a fabricated default.

`authority_valid`, `pull_request_recorded`, `ci_passed_for_current_head`,
and the `recovery_*` facts are computed from the identity, provider
operation, outcome, and recovery evidence `[SD]` wired in
`backend.app.core.runtime_service`.

`required_assurance_passed`, `assurance_fresh`, `deviations_resolved` and
`required_evidence_complete` come from `[KB]`'s `EvidenceService.assurance_facts`
when a provider is injected: the repository is re-inspected, so any edit after the
plan makes them `False`. They are computed only for the `LOCALLY_VERIFIED` and
`REVIEW_READY` guards. `artifact_recorded`, `deployment_recorded` and
`observation_criteria_met` remain `False` (no real adapter exists), so
`ARTIFACT_BUILT`, `DEPLOYED`, `OBSERVING` and `STABLE` stay honestly unreachable
through the real API, per this product's "no safety theater" invariant.
