"""Agent Launcher with Windows process-tree supervision.

Scope, deliberately narrow:

* On Windows, ``launch`` uses a kill-on-close Job Object, records descendants,
  and starts the top-level process with maximum privileges removed from a
  restricted token (the caller integrity level is retained for repository writes).
  Reduced privilege is not a sandbox or isolation boundary.
* ``attach`` records caller-declared metadata. Nothing is observed.
* ``stop`` terminates the owned Job Object tree when supervision is available.

Caller authority is enforced upstream (``PolicyPort``); the port carries no
actor, so this class cannot and does not authorize a caller. Run records live in
memory only; persisting them is a shared-core integration responsibility.
